concerns :
1.The multipectral planetscope image is giving a purple mask over the image, you can see this by running Pansharpening.ipynb file.
2.Can you try with your planetscope images matching sentinal2 scene and try runing my code to see for better resuts ?
3. Your comments of histograms and Pixel differences.
4. For reference you can see the first pansharpening methode and it's results in Pansharpening.ipynb

=============

I have created a tif image matching b2_sentinal2.tif,b3_sentinal2.tif,b4_sentinal2.tif (This is of 9th jan 2023) out of dense planetscope image (of 8th jan 2023). I have done this using QGIS software , and produced a cropped image matching the sentinal2 scene from dense planetscope image.
Output file is : pla.tif. 
Planetscope image used is in the folder : 'planetscope original dense image'

1. First need to run the resize.ipynb colab notebook for matching the shapes.
   Input data are : b2_sentinal2.tif,b3_sentinal2.tif,b4_sentinal2.tif and pla.tif
   Output data are : B2.tif,B3.tif,B4.tif

2. Then run the Pansharpening.ipynb fo running the Pansharpening.
   Input data are : B2.tif,B3.tif,B4.tif and pla.tif

   There are three methods of pansharpening, one by one in the code file. First one is gviing good results in terms of qualitative metrics like ERGAS values.
